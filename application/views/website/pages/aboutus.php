                        <p>Hello BPSC Aspirants. Wish you all a Very Good Day!!</p>
                        <p>When I (Siddharth Roy Choudhury) started preparing for BPSC in 2019, I was clueless and had no idea about any website which can help me in preparing for BPSC exam only, wherein I can pursue my on-going job as well as prepare for BPSC exam at my own pace.</p>
                        <p>Keeping this in mind, I always wished if there could had been some website dedicated only to BPSC exam Aspirants, and thus I started www.mybpscexam.com</p>
